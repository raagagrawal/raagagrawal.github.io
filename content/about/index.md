I'm an MD-PhD candidate in the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program, expecting to graduate in 2027. My doctoral research in the Boutros Lab in the Department of Human Genetics uses whole-genome sequencing and computational genomics to identify molecular subtypes of high-risk prostate cancer. I'm broadly interested in translational oncology, cancer genomics, and health disparities — and motivated by the goal of connecting genomic discoveries to better clinical outcomes.

Before starting at UCLA, I studied biology at Columbia University, where I graduated *Cum Laude* as an I.I. Rabi Scholar. I spent a year at the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, contributing to the Human Cell Atlas project through single-cell RNA sequencing of inflammatory bowel disease.

Outside the lab, I've served as President of the UCLA-Caltech MSTP Council and Chair of the MSTP Admissions Committee, and was elected as a North Westwood Neighborhood Council representative. I've been a delegate to the American Medical Association through the California Medical Association and remain active as a mentor through the American Physician Scientists Association. I review for journals including *JNCI Cancer Spectrum*.
