**Raag Agrawal, Ph.D.**

MD-PhD Candidate · [UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program](https://mstp.healthsciences.ucla.edu/)

I am a physician-scientist in training at the UCLA-Caltech Medical Scientist Training Program. My PhD research in the [Boutros Lab](https://www.uclahealth.org/departments/urology/iuo/research/faculty-labs/dr-paul-boutros-lab) in the Department of Human Genetics focuses on identifying molecular subtypes of high-risk prostate cancer using whole-genome sequencing and integrative genomic approaches.

My research interests span **translational oncology**, **cancer genomics**, and **health disparities**. I am passionate about leveraging computational and genomic tools to improve cancer diagnosis, treatment stratification, and outcomes — particularly for underserved populations.

Before UCLA, I graduated *Cum Laude* from Columbia University as an I.I. Rabi Scholar, and spent a year at the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Sanger Institute working on the Human Cell Atlas.
