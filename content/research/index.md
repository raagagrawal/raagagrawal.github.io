My research focuses on understanding the molecular heterogeneity of prostate cancer, with the goal of improving risk stratification and treatment for patients with aggressive disease. I use integrative genomic approaches — including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and methylation profiling — to identify molecular subtypes and biomarkers with clinical relevance.
