<p>January 30th, 2020</p>

<p>Standardized exams are under attack from a united progressive left that links them to socioeconomic and racial inequality. The University of California is beginning to examine whether it should require standardized exams for admission in recognition of the inequalities they allegedly perpetuate. Yet, I believe this movement toward less testing in favor of more qualitative approaches to admission reliant on the review of essays, portfolios, and extracurriculars will inevitably result in both a dramatic loss of access for poor and underrepresented Americans to higher education and the shattering of public trust in an admission process that will only become more opaque.

<p>Every year, children in New York City are born addicted to heroin. It’s easy to tell them apart from other newborns: They often never stop crying. They’re not calling out for their mothers, but for opioids. This local tragedy parallels the greater national opioid crisis that claimed over 45,000 lives—more than breast cancer—in 2017 alone. Columbia is responding to this tragedy by mobilizing researchers and clinicians to investigate effective treatments and implement therapies for those who are addicted. This enormous institutional effort is valiant, but to me, a farce. Because while physicians delve deep into their communities to reach those in need, Columbia seems to proudly stand by its own complicity in the crisis.

<p>April 17th, 2019</p>

<p>Many of us are rightfully outraged about the recent college admissions scandal roiling the nation, in which parents paid bribes to coaches to earn admission to elite schools across the country. But really, the problem isn’t that people are buying their way into colleges like Yale; that has been done from time immemorial. The main issue at hand is that we’ve given coaches so much importance in the admissions process. Today, even with record low admissions rates, roughly 20 percent of each Columbia class is recruited.
